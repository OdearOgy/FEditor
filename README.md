# Front-End Editor

A HTML/CSS/JS editor.

## Motivation

I was curious about how the codepen works and so decided to create something similar, but also simplistic. It wasn't that hard, and so this is going to be an ongoing project.

## TODO

- [ ] Dark/Light mode switcher

- [ ] Syntax highlighting

- [ ] Save code to a file

- [ ] User profiles
